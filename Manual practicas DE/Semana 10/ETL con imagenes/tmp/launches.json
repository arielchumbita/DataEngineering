The second stage will follow a suborbital trajectory and perform an unpowered splashdown approximately 100 km off the northwest coast of Kauai (Hawaii).","launch_designator":null,"type":"Test Flight","orbit":{"id":15,"name":"Suborbital","abbrev":"Sub"}},"pad":{"id":188,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.0.0/pad/188/","agency_id":121,"name":"Orbital Launch Mount A","info_url":null,"wiki_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_South_Texas_Launch_Site","map_url":"https://www.google.com/maps?q=25.997116,-97.15503099856647","latitude":"25.997116","longitude":"-97.15503099856647","location":{"id":143,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.0.0/location/143/","name":"SpaceX Space Launch Facility, TX, USA","country_code":"USA","map_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/location_143_20200803142438.jpg","total_launch_count":10,"total_landing_count":9},"map_image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/pad_orbital_launch_mount_a_20210514061342.jpg","total_launch_count":1},"webcast_live":false,"image":"https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/starship_image_20230523063525.jpeg","infographic":null,"program":[{"id":1,"url":"https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.0.0/program/1/","name":"SpaceX Starship","description":"The SpaceX Starship is a fully reusable super heavy-lift launch vehicle under development by SpaceX since 2012, as a self-funded private spaceflight project.
